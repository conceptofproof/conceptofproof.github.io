y? In the case of all things which have several parts and in which the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something be
side the parts, there is a cause; for even in bodies contact is the cause of unity in some cases, and in others viscosity or some other such q
uality. And a definition is a set of words which is one not by being connected together, like the Iliad, but by dealing with one object.-What 
then, is it that makes man one; why is he one and not many, e.g. animal + biped, especially if there are, as some say, an animal-itself and a 
biped-itself? Why are not those Forms themselves the man, so that men would exist by participation not in man, nor in-one Form, but in two, an
imal and biped, and in general man would be not one but more than one thing, animal and biped? \n");

    "Clearly, then, if people proceed thus in their usual manner of definition and speech, they cannot explain and solve the difficulty. But if, as we say, one element is matter and another is form, and one is potentially and the other actually, the question will no longer be thought a difficulty. For this difficulty is the same as would arise if 'round bronze' were the definition of 'cloak'; for this word would be a sign of the definitory formula, so that the question is, what is the cause of the unity of 'round' and 'bronze'? The difficulty disappears, because the one is matter, the other form. What, then, causes this-that which was potentially to be actually-except, in the case of things which are generated, the agent? For there is no other cause of the potential sphere's becoming actually a sphere, but this was the essence of either. Of matter some is intelligible, some perceptible, and in a formula there is always an element of matter as well as one of actuality; e.g. the circle is 'a plane figure'. But of the things which have no matter, either intelligible or perceptible, each is by its nature essentially a kind of unity, as it is essentially a kind of being-individual substance, quality, or quantity (and so neither 'existent' nor 'one' is present in their definitions), and the essence of each of them is by its very nature a kind of unity as it is a kind of being-and so none of these has any reason outside itself, for being one, nor for being a kind of being; for each is by its nature a kind of being and a kind of unity, not as being in the genus 'being' or 'one' nor in the sense that being and unity can exist apart from particulars. \n");

void readC(){

   printf(
    "Owing to the difficulty about unity some speak of 'participation', and raise the question, what is the cause of participation and what is it to participate; and others speak of 'communion', as Lycophron says knowledge is a communion of knowing with the soul; and others say life is a 'composition' or 'connexion' of soul with body. Yet the same account applies to all cases; for being healthy, too, will on this showing be either a 'communion' or a 'connexion' or a 'composition' of soul and health, and the fact that the bronze is a triangle will be a 'composition' of bronze and triangle, and the fact that a thing is white will be a 'composition' of surface and whiteness. The reason is that people look for a unifying formula, and a difference, between potency and complete reality. But, as has been said, the proximate matter and the form are one and the same thing, the one potentially, and the other actually. Therefore it is like asking what in general is the cause of unity and of a thing's being one; for each thing is a unity, and the potential and the actual are somehow one. Therefore there is no other cause here unless there is something which caused the movement from potency into actuality. And all things which have no matter are without qualification essentially unities. ");

If we run `checksec`, we can see that stack cookies, NX and partial RELRO are enabled.

{% highlight python%}
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : ENABLED
FORTIFY   : disabled
NX        : ENABLED
PIE       : disabled
RELRO     : Partial
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, this is a statically linked binary, so we cannot do a GOT overwrite.

## Vulnerability
There is a format string vulnerability in the `selectABook()` function which allows us to read arbitrary data off the stack, including the stack cookie.

{% highlight C %}
char buf_secure[512];
scanf("%s", buf_secure);
printf(buf_secure);
{% endhighlight %}

We can subsequently used our leaked stack cookie to overflow a buffer and patch the actual stack cookie to allow us to overflow even further to corrupt a function's return address.

**Unfortunately, `scanf()` does not read any bytes past the first NULL byte.** 
This is problematic, as all canaries begin with a NULL byte. 

Some examples of valid stack cookies:
{%highlight bash %}
run 1: 0xe8f1500
run 2: 0x949fde00 
run 3: 0xd405a00
run 4: 0x65977800 
{% endhighlight %}

So, to overwrite the remaining 3 bytes of the canary, we will need to instead, use a function that will continue reading our input after it encounters a NULL byte.

One such function exists in the `findSomeWords()` function.

{% highlight C %}
char buf[24];
read(STDIN, buf, 2048); // >> read a lot every day !
{% endhighlight %}

**`read()` does not stop reading after it encounters a NULL byte. It only stops reading after it encounters a newline char.**

This will allow us to patch the stack cookie and continue overwriting into the return address and beyond.

The only other things we need to do for this lab are to bypass the **XOR** check, find a `ret` gadget to move us up the stack, and to overwrite the stack starting at the address immediately before the saved return address, with a ROP chain. 

Putting everything together, the following solution granted me a shell.
