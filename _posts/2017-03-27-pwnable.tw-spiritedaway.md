## Intro
The program reads in user comments for the movie, "Spirited Away", and allows to user to repeatedly add new comments.
The pseudocode for the `survey()` function which does all the processing looks like the following.

{% highlight C %}
int survey()
{
  char printCommentNo; // [sp+10h] [bp-E8h]@2
  size_t hex3c; // [sp+48h] [bp-B0h]@1
  size_t hex50; // [sp+4Ch] [bp-ACh]@1
  char comment; // [sp+50h] [bp-A8h]@2
  int age; // [sp+A0h] [bp-58h]@2
  void *name; // [sp+A4h] [bp-54h]@2
  int reason; // [sp+A8h] [bp-50h]@2

  hex3c = 60;
  hex50 = 80;
LABEL_2:
  memset(&comment, 0, 0x50u);
  name = malloc(0x3Cu);
  printf("\nPlease enter your name: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  read(0, name, hex3c);
  printf("Please enter your age: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  __isoc99_scanf("%d", &age);                   // mallocs space for buffer
  printf("Why did you came to see this movie? ");
  fflush(stdout);
  read(0, &reason, hex50);
  fflush(stdout);
  printf("Please enter your comment: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  read(0, &comment, hex3c);
  ++cnt;
  printf("Name: %s\n", name);
  printf("Age: %d\n", age);
  printf("Reason: %s\n", &reason);
  printf("Comment: %s\n\n", &comment);
  fflush(stdout);
  sprintf(&printCommentNo, "%d comment so far. We will review them as soon as we can", cnt);// overflow if cnt >=100
  puts(&printCommentNo);
  puts(&s);
  fflush(stdout);
  if ( cnt > 199 )
  {
    puts("200 comments is enough!");
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(0);
  }
  while ( 1 )
  {
    printf("Would you like to leave another comment? <y/n>: ");
    fflush(stdout);
    read(0, &choice, 3u);
    if ( choice == 'Y' || choice == 'y' )
    {
      free(name);
      goto LABEL_2;
    }
    if ( choice == 'N' || choice == 'n' )
      break;
    puts("Wrong choice.");
    fflush(stdout);
  }
  puts("Bye!");
  return fflush(stdo
{% endhighlight %}

Each time a user wants to a new comment, the program asks us to enter several other fields.

{% highlight bash %}

1 comment so far. We will review them as soon as we can

Would you like to leave another comment? <y/n>: 
{% endhighlight %}

These fields are stored onto the stack like so:

![](../img/spirited_away_1.png)

The name is always placed in a heap chunk created via `malloc(0x3c)`.
A pointer to this heap chunk is placed on the stack.

As we add comments, a global variable keeping track of the number of comments is incremented.

Each time a new comment is added, the `namePtr` on the stack is `free()`'d and `malloc(0x3c)` is called to reallocate the heap chunk to store the name for the next comment.

## Vulnerability
After 10 comments are added, an extra byte is added to the `printCommentNo` buffer, since "10" in hex is actually `0x3130`.
This pushes the NULL byte at the end of the ***"%d comment so far. We will review them as soon as we can"*** string 1 byte farther up the stack. 

**This overwrites the `hex3c` variable that is used to perform `read()` calls, with `0x0`.**

{% highlight C %}
read(0, name, hex3c);
[...]
read(0, &comment, hex3c);
{% endhighlight %}

**Even worse, after 100 comments are added, an extra 2 bytes will be added to the `printCommentNo` buffer which will overwrite the `hex3c` variable with `0x6e`, since that is the hex equivalent of the character "n" in the word "can".**

**This allows us to write more data onto both the stack and a heap chunk than we are supposed to.**

## Exploit 
To exploit this vulnerability, I used the "House of Spirit" heap exploitation technique to craft a fake fastchunk on the stack which I free'd into a fastbin. Then the next `malloc(0x3c)` allocation, which requested the same size of the fastchunk we just freed, returned this stack address back, and I then wrote data into this stack address to overwrite the saved EIP with the address of a `one_shot` gadget to spawn a shell. 

Overall, right before `malloc(0x3c)` returned my desired stack address, I set the stack up to look something like this.

![](../img/spirited_away_2.png)

First I leaked a libc and stack address off the stack using the `reason` buffer which was insecurely printed.

Then I wrote 100 comments to overwrite the `hex3c` variable on the stack with `0x6e`.

Next, I crafted a fake `0x40` byte sized chunk on the stack as well as a fake next chunk right after it, with a valid size.
The reason I made the size of the fake chunk `0x40` is because we want it to be returned on the next `malloc()` and we already know the next `malloc()` will be `malloc(0x3c)` which will look for a chunk in the same fastbin as the one a sized `0x40` byte chunk would be placed in.

**Also, there has to be a chunk `0x40` bytes after our fake chunk, and this fake next chunk has to have a valid size, otherwise the memory allocator will throw a "free(): invalid next size (fast)" error!** 

{% highlight C%}
if (have_lock
        || ({ assert (locked == 0);
          mutex_lock(&av->mutex);
          locked = 1;
          chunk_at_offset (p, size)->size <= 2 * SIZE_SZ
            || chunksize (chunk_at_offset (p, size)) >= av->system_mem;
          }))
      {
        errstr = "free(): invalid next size (fast)";
        goto errout;
      }
{% endhighlight %}

In gdb, our fake chunk and next fake chunk will look something like this:
{% highlight bash %}
gdb-peda$ x/20xg 0x7fffffffde60-0x10
0x7fffffffde50: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000040 <--- size of fastbin-sized fake chunk must equal size of next malloc() request
0x7fffffffde60: 0x0000000000ff0000      0x0000ff0000000000 <--- free(0x7fffffffde60)
0x7fffffffde70: 0x0000000000000001      0x00000000004007ed
0x7fffffffde80: 0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
0x7fffffffde90: 0x00000000004007a0      0x0000000000002240 <--- size of next chunk must be >0x10 bytes and <0x2100 bytes
0x7fffffffdea0: 0x00007fffffffdf90      0xc69c8f667f6a2a00 
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, after the next `malloc(0x3c)` I was able to write `0x6e` bytes onto the stack starting at address `0x7fffffffde60`, which was enough to overwrite the saved EIP with my `one_shot` gadget.

Putting everything together, the following was my final exploit script.
